# vanilla-js-shopping-list

- This was from Andrei Neagoie's Udemy course
- In the course, jQuery was not taught yet, so I refrained from using it.

## What it does

- You can add an item to the list
- You can delete an item to the list

## Future Plans

- Add a "delete all" button
- Add a way to sort items
